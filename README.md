# Project Title

MY LIBRARY

## Goals
1. add a book to library with API info by scanning it in (ehhhh only needed at first may be too much, can use sheets)
2. ~~add a book to library with API info by typing in the ISBN~~
3. view full library & filter it (add author here before calling this done)
4. ~~search the full library~~
5. sort the full library
6. ~~change a books details~~
7. charts & figures 
   - flexible charts/figures 
   - total pages read
   - total books & per filters
   - average ratings per filters
   - read vs not read counts per filters
   - genre heat map
8. digital TBR you can drag and drop onto
9. recommendations based on selection criteria
10. sorting?
11. total count?

## Notes & Reminders
1. There is a < next to the fetch button.
2. Look into subjects which are nested below categories in the API.
4. You need a duplicate check.
5. Want the ISBN showed somewhere once entered in case you want to refresh.
6. Probably want a GitHub page, load/reload sucks.
7. Maybe get your goodreads data somehow?
8. Do you care about date read? You won't know so many.

## Progress
- Pre Jan 10th tracking: library loads, add book button adds a card to the front, card populated with what I want, click on card to open details, can search API via ISBN, can edit details and save, back button, save button, can set star rating, can change yes/no button on read, library saved upon reload of page (local storage), UI very clean & pretty
- January 10th: filter for read/not and genre (including user-added) and a clear  filters button, merged the save button into the back button
- January 11th: (admin day) annotated all the code & set up the github framework better for future-proofing
- January 18th: got the search working (card hiding)

## Documentation
- Make a file map & diagrams
- Make a copy-&-paste for repeating things (class css, function content when pulling from API, new button, adding filter, etc.)
- site map
- design & color guidelines (brand page)
- limitations or instructions (e.g., API may be blank)
- feature list details
